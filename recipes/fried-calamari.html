    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Calamari translated from Italian means squid served as food. This particular dish originates in Italy but due to the extensive network of trade routes became introduced to a number of different cultures. It didn't appear until 1975 in the United States when the New York Times published an article that brought it to the public eye. During the 1980s it started gaining popularity but was only offered in high class and exotic restaurants. It wasn't until 1985 that the idea of it being a dish only the well-to-do could afford started to diminish. By 1996 it was relabeled as a trendy dish and has continued to be a popular food. Fried calamari may seem like an intimidating recipe, but we assure you that it’s super simple to make at home with many ingredients you probably already have.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Thaw Calamari in the refrigerator for 6 hours or if you require faster thawing, we recommend placing the product into a non-vacuum sealed bag and placing it in cool water for around thirty minutes to an hour.</li>
            <li>Stir together ingredients for cocktail sauce. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Rinse calamari under cool water and strain. Slice calamari tubes into rings and place on a paper towel lined plate. Once all calamari are sliced, blot with paper towel to remove water. Transfer to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add beaten egg to calamari and stir to coat.</li>
            <li>In a separate shallow bowl, stir together flour, cornstarch, paprika, salt and pepper. Working in 3 batches, add some calamari to the flour mixture allowing excess egg to run back into bowl. Toss calamari in flour then transfer to a mesh strainer over a bowl and shake off excess flour.</li>
            <li>Transfer coated calamari to a clean bowl and repeat with remaining calamari.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 inch of oil in a deep frying pan to 340ºF-350ºF. Once oil is heated, gently add a handful of calamari to the oil and fry for 2 minutes, or until golden brown. Transfer to a paper towel lined plate using a slotted spoon and repeat with remaining calamari.</li>
            <li>Serve calamari warm garnished with fresh parsley, lemon wedges and cocktail sauce for dipping.</li>
        </ol>
